Real Time Open Board

This is a realtime open board project for real time graphical drawing. 
I've used canvas API and also web socket's socket io library.

API: Canvas API(for 2D graphical drawing)
Realtime Drawing: Socket io, Express(server)

Features:
1) Pen: Pen of multiple colours and width.
2) Eraser: Eraser to erase the drawings, size of eraser can be changed.
3) Dowload: User can download the openboard image/ content they've created.
4) Upload: User can upload an image from their local storage.
5) Notes: User will be able to add sticky notes on their board with special drag and drop effect.
6) Undo 
7) Redo

lineTo =>
stroke =>


To Move according to your mouse 
// tool.beginPath(); //new graphic / new path
// tool.moveTo(10, 10); //start point
// tool.lineTo(100, 150); //end point
// tool.stroke(); // to fill color in the invisible

// tool.beginPath();
// tool.moveTo(100, 200);
// tool.lineTo(200, 200);
// tool.stroke();

// =============== I want to start my path whenever i click
// mousedown => Start new path
// mouse mover => Path fill
// mouse up => End path


Socket io: Realtime Data Flow
Dependecies:
We'd need a server, we'll make that server through Express


Why install NodeMod ??
So that even if our application crashes it can restart
